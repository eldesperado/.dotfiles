Dotfiles
========

After cloning this repo, run `install` to automatically set up the development
environment. Note that the install script is idempotent: it can safely be run
multiple times.

For the color scheme to look right, you will also need terminal-specific
support. The configuration for that, along with a whole bunch of other
machine-specific configuration, is located in [dotfiles-local][dotfiles-local].

Dotfiles uses [Dotbot][dotbot] for installation.
